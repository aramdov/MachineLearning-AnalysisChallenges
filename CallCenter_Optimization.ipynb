    "\n",
    "Department the call is in\n",
    "- A categorical variable that will have a value for each department in the call center.\n",
    "- Can isolate the values to forecast call volume per department. Our allocation of staffing will be broken up per department based on its expected call volume and average handling time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time call was made\n",
    "- Using the time for each call we can plot time-series graphs of the calls over time.\n",
    "- It will be useful to analyze time series motifs, trends, seasonality, and residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total waiting time\n",
    "- This is the objective variable that is to be minimized subject to multiple constraints on labor costs and staffing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total length of the call\n",
    "- This can be combined with other variables to create a metric for the amount of work that staffers have.\n",
    "- It requires creativity in feature engineering to make relevant metrics to measure call performance, staffing efficiency, and costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analysis\n",
    "**Problem:** The problem is that we want to optimize call center staffing to minimize waiting time for customers and keep labor costs low. Using a historical log of calls, we would like to construct relevant metrics and use that in modeling the factors that influence waiting time. The first thing I would address is what are the acceptable values for waiting time and labor costs to define the problem more concretely. Surely there will be trade-offs in constructing a schedule that minimizes waiting times and keeps costs low and we would like to find a range of balance or equilibrium that is acceptable. For example, my intuition says if I lower the number of employees staffed, I will lower labor costs but also increase waiting times and vice versa. These opposing relationships are a common theme in economic multivariate models, especially in microeconomics. It is a classic optimization problem with constraints. The problem then is to quantify these relationships and see if we can find an acceptable balance to optimize staff scheduling and minimize costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issues:** The complex system behind a call center is intricate and hard to gain an understanding of. There are *confounding* variables and *coupling* effects which can be demonstrated by analyzing the historical data. In addition, the distribution of call volume over time is unknown for the most part, and the change in the effect of one variable on another contains elements of non-linearity and linearity at different rates. At a high level, it is a dynamic system making it tough to model but also an exciting problem to tackle that is relevant to the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Wrangling and Pre-Processing:** Perform necessary operations to clean data for errors, missing values, corrupt logs, and other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Engineering:** Use the variables given to construct new metrics and help measure call center performance and operations. Some metrics that come to mind are:\n",
    "- Call volume per interval of time(30minutes) per department\n",
    "- Average length of call per 30 minutes to measure the efficiency\n",
    "- Work Volume = Length of call * Call Volume\n",
    "- And more as necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploratory Data Analysis:** It is necessary to understand the statistical descriptions of your data at a high level. Construct plots such as histograms, correlation matrices, box plots to compare departments, and see if you can find any correlations, trends or relationships within the data. With visualizations, you can easily detect outliers, interesting insights, and characteristics of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model and Approach:** \n",
    "\n",
    "I would start with time series modeling for call volume over time. We will want to extract trends, seasonality, and residuals. The seasonality factors can span different periods such as annual, quarterly, monthly and weekly. By using all periods you can craft a high and low-level picture of the call volume in addition to extracting different patterns over time. Once we have isolated the information from the time series we can analyze the effects on call volume from seasonality, trend and the residual to understand the behavior through time. This would be done with every department and give insight to the data generating process underlying call volume over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To forecast future call volume I would also utilize an exponential smoothing model. This helps reduce volatile short-term fluctuations. Exponential smoothing uses lagged observations of the dependent variable in the regression. Each observation in the past receives less weight and these weights decline *exponentially*. In practice, exponential smoothing often performs better with a lower MAE(Mean Absolute Error) than other methods such as lagged and centered rolling averages. A tough challenge with exponential smoothing is picking a value, often referred to as alpha, which determines the decreasing weights in the lagged variables. There is no right answer, it is best to experiment with different values of alpha to observe model performance and also consider the value that minimizes the sum of squared forecast errors. Another challenge is the initial value required for exponential smoothing, there is no obvious choice and I would experiment with different values such as averages over different time periods. These challenges can be addressed by measuring model performances with different values set and picking the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step will be to figure out how to optimize staffing allocations *conditional* on our forecast and historical performance. The output of this model will give a reasonable forecast of expected call volume in addition to an analysis of the composition within the time-series. Once there is an accurate estimate of call volume and an understanding of its patterns, it can be used to efficiently schedule staffers based on a reasonable estimate and help solve the problem of optimizing schedules and minimizing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the forecasted call volume and the average length of a call by 30-minute intervals we can predict the upcoming workload for each department by any time interval including intraday, weekly and monthly. Based on the goals of the call center for how fast it wants to service calls and minimize waiting times and labor cost we can create a mathematical formula to allocate staffing. There are several developed models like Erlang's Formula, First in first out servicing, Priority-based, Last in First out, and more. These models address allocating the limited resource which is staffing based on constraints imposed in the problem such as the acceptable range of waiting times and labor costs. If we knew more about the dataset we could go through these models and weigh the pros and cons behind the suitability for the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worthwhile discussing some of the relationships and constraints in the optimization problem. The relationship between the waiting time(y-axis) and the number of staffers(x-axis) will resemble a downward sloping curve similar to the function y=1/x. In Economics this is interpreted as diminishing returns to marginal productivity. There is a point in the curve where scheduling another staffer doesn't decrease the waiting time enough to justify the additional cost it adds which is the marginal cost. We look to schedule the number of staffers where Marginal Cost is equal to Marginal Productivity for the firm to minimize costs and maximize productivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of these curves is shown here: <img src=\"https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/diminishing-returns-mc-mp.png\" alt=\"\" title = \"A sample demonstration of the marginal productivity and cost curves concerning the number of workers\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "A note to add is that this is the optimal solution as proposed by microeconomic theory assuming that the productivity contributed by additional workers is an accurate and quantifiable metric. In the real world you would probably allocate a little more than this optimal solution to have a buffer of excess workers in the cases when people are unable to work such as calling in sick, meetings, training, out-of-desk work. It is generally better to have more workers than necessary so you are still providing a great service and account for staff shrinkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative method 1:** You can treat the number of calls as a feature and plot time-series graphs with call volume on the y-axis, time on the x-axis, and a line for each department. In addition, it would be worthwhile to cluster other metrics such as waiting time and length of the call. For each relationship with time, you would run a k-means clustering algorithm and see if there similar performing departments in each cluster. Before clustering the data you would make the following choices for pre-processing, initialization and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the data need to be scaled and or centered prior to clustering?\n",
    "- How do you decide the initial parameter value, in this case, centroids?\n",
    "- How do you determine the number of clusters to use for the next step in analyzing similar call patterns across departments?\n",
    "- Check if resulting clusters reflect any similarities across departments\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then predict characteristics of calls in volume, waiting and handling time per cluster and assign similar staffing requirements to all departments within each cluster. This would be a neat way to allocate staffing across departments that exhibit similar behavior in calls and provide a forecast of call volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative method 2:** Another possible alternative is building a regression model where the dependent variable is waiting time and the explanatory variables consist of the metrics created with the starting variables. These variables could be staffing level, average length of call per 30 minutes, average number of calls per 30 minutes and a lagged observation of waiting time for the last 30 minutes. There could be a possible use to add more lagged observations or other metrics created in the regression as well. It would be best to run this regression for each department instead of the whole call center. In addition, you would consider interaction terms between the explanatory variables as well. By discovering the coefficients for these explanatory variables you can input parameter values back into the regression and predict the waiting time you would get as well as look at changes in waiting times from increasing or decreasing the value of a variable. Utilizing this method you can find an allocation of values in the variables that results in the lowest waiting time while maintaining costs low."
