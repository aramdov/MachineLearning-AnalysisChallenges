Suppose that you are trying to make day-to-day financial management easier for Americans.
You have access to the financial transactions of millions of Americans.
This data includes a customer ID, business ID, transaction date and time, and transaction value.
You would like to build a tool that identifies the recurring transactions in a person's statement, and helps them plan for
their bills in the next month.
Outline how you might approach this problem according to the instructions above.


Task #2: Staff Allocation
Imagine that you manage a large call center, and are trying to optimize staffing across the center.
You have access to a historical log of call times.
This data includes the department that a call was placed to, the time the call was made, the total waiting time, and the
total length of the call.
You would like to set staff shifts so that you minimize waiting times while keeping costs low.
Outline how you might approach this problem according to the instructions above.
